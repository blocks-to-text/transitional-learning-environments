# Transitional Learning Environments

Choosing the right programming language and environment is one of the most important decisions you make. It's possible to come up with new projects and lessons on the fly, but it is very disruptive for your students' learning to change languages or environments partway through a course.

You know your students, what are they ready for? what would be most engaging for them? The transition from beginner environments to full text-based programming isn't one skill and one step. Choosing an environment that matches your students' current levels and interests is key.

Making the right choice will involve determining which of the skills you want to address (text? notional machine? computational thinking?) and the types of projects that will be most effective for your students (visual? investigative?). The different environments provide more or less support for different skills and project types.

This repository is a reference to good programming environments to consider after Scratch and it's ilk, organized by which learning objective they best support.  One environment might appear in multiple categories if appropriate.

##  Blocks to Text

* [BlockPy](https://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/load)
    * Python
    * Edit in blocks, text, or view them both at once
    * Readily import and work with real-world data sets
    * Ideal for first steps into authentic data analysis
    * No runtime visualizations
    * Very helpful error messages, feedback and console
* [Trinket](https://trinket.io)
    * Python, HTML/CSS, Java, R, PyGame
    * In blocks projects, the corresponding python can be seen side-by-side.  A new Python trinket can be generated from any blocks project.
    * Supports turtles, art, music, games, and bare programming
    * Many great tutorials and challenges
    * Can share and remix projects
* [PencilCode](https://pencilcode.net/edit/first) 
    * CoffeeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
    * Can edit the same project in blocks or code, toggling between the two.
    * Turtles, Music, Art or Adventures
    * Can share and remix projects

## Program Execution


* [Thonny](https://thonny.org)
    * Python
    * Step through program execution down to the expression level
    * Good visualization of function calls
    * Can't step backwards through execution
    * Paired with Birdseye, this is a best option for pure-text programming
* [birdseye](https://birdseye.readthedocs.io)
    * Python
    * Not a standalone environment, but a module.  It can be used with any standard Python editor/runtime.  Stores records of variables & function calls throughout program execution.  Students can then go back and inspect or debug their programs
    * Can step forward or backwards 
    * Expression-level inspecting
    * Paired with Thonny, this is a best option for pure-text programming

* [BlockPy](https://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/load)
    * Python
    * Edit in blocks, text, or view them both at once
    * Readily import and work with real-world data sets
    * Ideal for first steps into authentic data analysis
    * No runtime visualizations
    * Very helpful error messages, feedback and console
* [Thonny](https://thonny.org) + [birdseye](https://birdseye.readthedocs.io)

* [General Purpose Blocks (GP)](http://gpblocks.org)
    * Blocks for adults and the serious programmer
    * Can do everything Scratch can do
    * Can also accompany learners through systems modeling, data manipulation & analysis
    * Can access API's and cloud data
    * Build and deploy projects 
    * Connect to and program hardware
* [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org)
    * Racket, a Scheme-like functional language
    * Can also execute student or teacher created variations and extensions of Racket
    * Explore the connections between mathematics, computing theory & programming
    * Study programming languages by extending Racket
    * Build applications for modeling and analysis
    * Share and extend projects between students
